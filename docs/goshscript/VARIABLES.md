# Variables

Variables come in two visibilities:
 - Public variables stay visible after closing the current scope (function / script file)
 - Private variables are discarded when leaving the current scope

Public variables are indicated with a leading `$`, private ones are indicated with a leading `ยง`.

Variable names can contain alphanumeric characters and underscores `_`.
